                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    ::marker
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    ::marker
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.
